# Text Comparison React Apps â€“ Project Overview & Comparison


This repository contains four different implementations of a text comparison tool, each built with React and Vite, and styled with Tailwind CSS. The apps allow users to compare two pieces of text side by side, with visual highlighting of differences. Each project explores different approaches and technologies, providing a useful reference for React developers.
